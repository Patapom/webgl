You will find mostly articles about math and rendering.

I specialize in lighting, from the microscopic [BRDF](BRDF) to the macroscopic interactive indirect lighting simulation in 3D scenes.

I :heart: every light-related phenomenon, from emission to scattering, interaction and perception. The beautiful intricacies of matter playing with photons, often in mysterious ways, yielding the most jaw-dropping patterns and colors.
